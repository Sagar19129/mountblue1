#Question 1
What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

The Feynman Technique is a simple four-step learning method where you write down a concept, 
explain it in plain language as if teaching a child, identify gaps in your understanding, and refine your explanation until it’s crystal clear.

#Question 2
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting part for me was the story of Dali and Edison—they used simple tricks like holding keys or ball bearings while dozing off,so when they dropped,it woke them up with new ideas. 
I liked it because it shows that even great minds used small, smart habits to spark creativity.

#Question 3
What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Focused mode is when your mind is fully concentrating on one thing, like solving a problem step by step. 
Diffuse mode is when you relax and let your mind wander, and that helps you see new ideas or solutions more easily.


#Question 4
According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

According to the video, the steps to take when learning something new are:
-Break the skill into smaller parts.
-Learn just enough to practice and correct yourself.
-Remove distractions and barriers.
-Commit to at least 20 hours of practice.

#Question 5
What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

To improve my learning process, I can start by working with full focus and removing distractions like phone notifications or social media. 
I will give my full attention when I work and take proper breaks when I play. 
Using tools like time trackers can also help me stay mindful of how I spend time. 
While learning, I should try to explain concepts in my own words, understand where they are used, and practice writing code for them. 
Instead of rushing for deadlines, I will focus on really understanding and enjoying the topic. 
I also want to master a few skills deeply rather than trying to learn everything at once. 
Lastly, I will communicate clearly, share any problems early, and keep checking my progress so I can keep improving.
